### Description

Ok, it's been ages and ages since I have posted any code. Kind of got sick of people ripping code and making claim for their own, so I removed pretty much all code I ever posted. Anyway, things aside, this application will remove that DCOM Worm that was realeased. Pretty simple. I would like to take the time to add, that the registry code I used was from Master Spy's startup adder/remover. Basically because it was right there, and I was a lil too lazy to code it myself. Same goes for the shutdown code, which was from one of Federico Bridger's examples, for the same reason, heh. Enjoy.
